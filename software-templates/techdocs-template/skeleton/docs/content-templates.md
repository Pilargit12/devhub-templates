# Document title
Create a title that captures the essence of the documentation.

* The title will contain the only  **H1** heading though the entire the document. 

* Write the title in sentence case for example: 

    * **Correct way**  
     How to build an application 
    * **Incorrect way**  
How To Build An Application  
How to Build an Application   
how to build an application 

## Version history
It is important for readers to know the last revision of any document. 

You can write the date below the main title:

**Document title**  
Last updated: **Month day, year**


**How to build and application**  
Last updated: **January 1, 2024**

## Table of contents
Generate an automated table of contents for easy navigation.

## Introduction
Briefly explain the purpose and scope of the documentation. 

An  introduction can be written from a few sentences to a couple of paragraphs, perhaps 3 maximum.  Readers should be able to quickly grasp the purpose of the documentation, the value it provides, and any key information needed to get started.

Write the brief introduction explaining the following questions: 

* What is the document's purpose? 
* Who is the intended reader? 
* What can the readers expect to to find? 
* Why is service or application important? 
* How should readers approach the documentation?
* Are there any prerequisites or dependencies?
* Are there any call to action(s)? 

If readers require more detailed background information, consider providing links to additional resources or dedicated sections within the documentation rather than extending the introduction excessively.

The goal of the introduction is to strike a balance between providing essential information and respecting the reader's time and attention.
