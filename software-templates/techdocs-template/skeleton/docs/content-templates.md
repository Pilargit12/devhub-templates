# Content template creation 
This is a guide that can help your team establish a good structure for content creation and inspiration to develop technical documents. 


## Document title
Create a title that captures the essence of the documentation.

* The title will contain the only  **H1** heading though the entire the document. 

* Use sentence case for example: 

    * **Correct way**  
     How to build an application 
    * **Incorrect way**  
How To Build An Application  
How to Build an Application   
how to build an application 

Sentence case means that in headings and page titles you should only capitalize:

* The first word, if it starts with a number such as '2023 Sysdiq monitor', you capitalize the first word after the number.

* [Proper nouns](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/capitalization)

* [Abbreviations and acronyms](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/abbreviations) if they have already been defined or are better known to the audience than their long-form equivalent, such as PDF or DNA 

## Version history
It is important for readers to know the last revision of any document.  

You can write the date below the main title:

**Document title**  
Last updated: **Month day, year**


**How to build and application**  
Last updated: **January 1, 2024**

## Table of contents
The system will automatically generate a table of contents or also known as "on this page" based on the type of headings you use.  Refer to the B.C. goverment's webstyle guide on the use of [writing headings and page titles](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/headings)

Example for heading's format: 

# Heading level 1 - H1  
Every page will contain one header level 1 which is given to the title of your page.

## Heading level 2 - H2
These are the main headings on your page and can be used several times.

### Heading level 3 - H3
These can also be used several times and are sub-headings to H2.

#### Heading level 4 -H4 
And these are sub-sub-headings to H3 but it is suggested would avoid these and beyond this level.

## Introduction
Briefly explain the purpose and scope of the documentation. 

An  introduction can be written from a few sentences to a couple of paragraphs, perhaps 3 maximum.  Readers should be able to quickly grasp the purpose of the documentation, the value it provides, and any key information needed to get started.

Write the brief introduction explaining the following questions: 

* What is the document's purpose? 
* Who is the intended reader? 
* What can the readers expect to to find? 
* Why is service or application important? 
* How should readers approach the documentation?
* Are there any prerequisites or dependencies?
* Are there any call to action(s)? 

If readers require more detailed background information, consider providing links to additional resources or dedicated sections within the documentation rather than extending the introduction excessively.

The goal of the introduction is to strike a balance between providing essential information and respecting the reader's time and attention.
