# Content template creation 
Explore this  guide to empower your team in crafting a robust framework for content creation while discovering valuable resources to lead the development of technical documents in your dedicated library in the B.C. government DevHub

Whether you're enhancing existing content or embarking on new projects, this guide equips you with the essential references and a template to ensure effective communication and compelling documentation.

## Document template
Use this document template to create a consistent format for both existing and new pages in your team's documentation library.

### Document title
Create a title that captures the essence of the documentation.

* The title will contain the only  **H1** heading though the entire the document. 

* Use sentence case for example: 

    * **Correct way**  
     How to build an application 
    * **Incorrect way**  
How To Build An Application  
How to Build an Application   
how to build an application 

Sentence case means that in headings and page titles you should only capitalize:

* The first word, if it starts with a number such as '2023 Sysdiq monitor', you capitalize the first word after the number

* [Proper nouns](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/capitalization)

* [Abbreviations and acronyms](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/abbreviations) if they have already been defined or are better known to the audience than their long-form equivalent, such as PDF or DNA 

### Version history
It is important for readers to know the last revision of any document.  

You can write the date below the main title:

**Document title**  
Last updated: **Month day, year**


**How to build and application**  
Last updated: **January 1, 2024**

**Choosing 'Last reviewed' vs "Last updated'**<br>
If you have read through he content to make sure it's accurate and up-to-date but have made no changes use 'Last reviewed'.

If you have made any edits, no matter how small, use 'Last updated'. 


### Table of contents
The system will automatically generate a table of contents or also known as "on this page" based on the type of headings you use.  Refer to the B.C. goverment's webstyle guide on the use of [writing headings and page titles](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/service-experience-digital-delivery/web-content-development-guides/web-style-guide/writing-guide/headings)

Example for heading's format: 

# Heading level 1 - H1  
Every page will contain one header level 1 which is given to the title of your page.

## Heading level 2 - H2
These are the main headings on your page and can be used several times.

### Heading level 3 - H3
These can also be used several times and are sub-headings to H2.

#### Heading level 4 -H4 
And these are sub-sub-headings to H3 but it is suggested would avoid these and beyond this level.

### How to introduce your topic
Briefly explain the purpose and scope of the documentation. 

An  introduction can be written from a few sentences to a couple of paragraphs, perhaps 3 maximum.  Readers should be able to quickly grasp the purpose of the documentation, the value it provides, and any key information needed to get started.

Write the brief introduction explaining the following questions: 

* What is the document's purpose? 
* Who is the intended reader? 
* What can the readers expect to to find? 
* Why is service or application important? 
* How should readers approach the documentation?
* Are there any prerequisites or dependencies?
* Are there any call to action(s)? 

If readers require more detailed background information, consider providing links to additional resources or dedicated sections within the documentation rather than extending the introduction excessively.

The goal of the introduction is to strike a balance between providing essential information and respecting the reader's time and attention.
